This repository contains a PythonÂ® wrapper for the NTIA/ITS implementation of
Recommendation ITU-R P.2108. This Recommendation contains three methods for the
prediction of clutter loss: Height Gain Terminal Correction Model, Terrestrial
Statistical Model, and Aeronautical Statistical Model. The software implements
Section 3 of Annex 1 of the Recommendation. This Python package wraps the
[base C++ implementation](https://github.com/NTIA/p2108).

## Getting Started ##

This software is distributed on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/proplib-p2108) and is easily installable
using the following command.

```cmd
pip install proplib-p2108
```

General information about using this model is available on
[its page on the **NTIA/ITS Propagation Library Wiki**](https://ntia.github.io/propagation-library-wiki/models/P2108/).
Additionally, Python-specific instructions and code examples are available
[here](https://ntia.github.io/propagation-library-wiki/models/P2108/python).

If you're a developer and would like to contribute to or extend this repository,
please review the guide for contributors [here](CONTRIBUTING.md) or open an
[issue](https://github.com/NTIA/p2108-python/issues) to start a discussion.

## Development ##

This repository contains code which wraps [the C++ shared library](https://github.com/NTIA/p2108)
as an importable Python module. If you wish to contribute to this repository,
testing your changes will require the inclusion of this shared library. You may retrieve
this either from the
[relevant GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/NTIA/p2108/releases), or by
compiling it yourself from the C++ source code. Either way, ensure that the shared library
(`.dll`, `.dylib`, or `.so` file) is placed in `src/ITS/ITU/PSeries/P2108/`, alongside `__init__.py`.

Below are the steps to build and install the Python package from source, including
compiling the library from the C++ source code. Working installations of Git and
Python (3.9 or above) are required. If compiling the shared library, CMake and a C++ compiler
are also required.

1. Clone the parent repository, then initialize the Git submodule containing the
Python wrapper. This repository structure makes test data available to the Python
wrapper.

    ```cmd
    # Clone the parent repository
    git clone https://github.com/NTIA/p2108
    cd p2108

    # Initialize Git submodules (wrappers and external dependencies)
    git submodule init

    # Clone the submodules
    git submodule update
    ```

1. Compile the C++ library for your platform, following instructions
[here](https://github.com/NTIA/p2108?tab=readme-ov-file#configure-and-build).
Following these instructions should automatically copy the shared library
into the location required by the Python wrapper.

    **OR**

    Download the shared library (`.dll`, `.so`, or `.dylib`) from a
    [GitHub Release](https://github.com/NTIA/p2108/releases). Then place the'
    downloaded file in `src/ITS/ITU/PSeries/P2108/` (alongside `__init__.py`).

1. Install the local package and development dependencies:

    ```cmd
    cd wrap/python
    pip install .[dev]
    ```

1. To build the wheel for your platform:

    ```cmd
    hatchling build
    ```

### Running Tests ###

Python unit tests can be run to confirm successful installation. Test data is
expected to be located in the parent repository. Therefore, if you haven't cloned
this repository as a submodule (as described above), you will need to first specify
the location of the test data files in `tests/test_p2108.py` (using the `TEST_DATA_DIR`
variable). Then, run the tests with pytest:

```cmd
pytest
```

Additionally, the [Study Group Clutter Excel Workbook](https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-R/study-groups/rsg3/ionotropospheric/Clutter%20and%20BEL%20workbook_V2.xlsx)
contains an extensive set of example values which are useful as validation cases.
